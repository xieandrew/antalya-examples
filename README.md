# Altinity Project Antalya Examples

Project Antalya is a new branch of ClickHouse® code designed to
integrate real-time analytic query with data lakes.  This project
provides documentation as well as working code examples to help you use
and contribute to Antalya.

*Important Note!* Altinity maintains and supports Project Antalya. Altinity 
is not affiliated or associated with ClickHouse Inc any way. ClickHouse® is 
a registered trademark of ClickHouse, Inc.

[Community Support Section](#community-support) if you want to ask 
questions or log ideas and issues.

## Project Antalya Goals

Analytic data size has increased to a point where traditional designs
based on shared-nothing architectures and block storage are prohibitively
expensive to operate. Project Antalya introduces a fully open source
architecture for cost-efficient, real-time systems using cheap object
storage and scalable compute, specifically:

* Enable real-time analytics to work off a single copy of
  data that is shared with AI and data science applications.
* Provide a single SQL endpoint for native ClickHouse® and data lake data.
* Use open table formats to enable easy access from any application type.
* Separate compute and storage; moreover, allow users to scale compute 
  for ingest, merge, transformation, and query independently. 

Antalya will implement these goals through the following concrete features:

1. Optimize query performance of ClickHouse® on Parquet files stored 
   S3-compatible object storage. 
2. Enable ClickHouse® clusters to add pools of stateless servers aka swarm
   clusters that handle query and insert operations on shared object storage 
   files with linear scaling.
3. Adapt ClickHouse® to use Iceberg tables as shared storage.
4. Enable ClickHouse® clusters to extend existing tables onto unlimited
   Iceberg storage with transparent query across both native MergeTree and
   Parquet data. 
5. Simplify backup and DR by leveraging Iceberg features like snapshots.
6. Maintain full compability with upstream ClickHouse® features and
   bug fixes.


## Getting Started

See the [Antalya Setup Guide](docs/setup.md) to learn how to set up Antalya on different environments.

If you want to quickly try out Antalya locally using Docker Compose, see the [Docker Quick Start](./docker/README.md).

### Scalable Swarm Example

For a fully functional swarm cluster implementation, look at the
[kubernetes](kubernetes/README.md) example. It demonstrates use of swarm
clusters on a large blockchain dataset stored in Parquet.

## Project Antalya Binaries

### Packages

Project Antalya ClickHouse® server and keeper packages are available on the 
[builds.altinity.cloud](https://builds.altinity.cloud/) page. Scan to the last 
section to find them. 

### Containers

Project Antalya ClickHouse® server and ClickHouse® keeper containers
are available on Docker Hub.

Check for the latest build on 
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/altinity/clickhouse-server/tags). 

## Documentation
